<summary>Motivation</summary>

Our project is driven by the goal of empowering students to effectively manage their time and achieve their goals within the demanding context of a fast-paced learning environment. We strive to provide tools and resources that assist students in staying organised, enhancing their productivity, and ultimately reducing stress levels, thereby promoting overall well-being.

Time and workload management stands as a prominent concern among NUS students who aim to optimise their limited time during their university years.

A common challenge arises when numerous assignments are suddenly assigned within a single week, as lecturers and professors from different modules release their respective tasks (e.g. the week before recess week). This influx of assignments can create difficulties in tracking assignments for students who are already juggling various activities, such as involvement in NUS student organisations. Furthermore, students may have additional personal aspirations, such as learning a programming language or acquiring skills beyond the scope of their NUS curriculum.

Additionally, keeping up with Canvas Announcements can become overwhelming, as they often multiply in number and complexity.

<summary>Aim</summary>

We hope to provide students with a convenient way to effectively manage their time for studies, hobbies and their personal interests, without needing to spend a lot of energy on planning via:

syncing of NUSMods, Canvas and studentsâ€™ personal schedules into 1 calendar to allow easier timetabling and planning for events.

To-Do List to enable students to track and manage their tasks and assignments easily.

Course Announcements to enable students to be up to date.

Configurable Timers such as Pomodoro Timers to aid students with simple productivity methods.
