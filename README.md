<summary>Motivation</summary>
Time and workload management is one of the main concerns of NUS students who aspire to make full use of their limited time during their university days. 

There are occasions when there are suddenly so many assignments that are to be completed by students in a week, when the lecturers and professors from different modules release assignments in the same week (e.g the week before recess week). This can make keeping track of assignments difficult for students who are swamped with other activities such as their NUS student organisations. This is also on top of other aspirations they have, such as learning a programming language or a skill outside of NUS.

There are also Canvas Announcements which can get out of hand in terms of following them.
